# Text Mining Homework

This repository contains the seccond Introduction to Text Mining and Natural 
Language Processing homework structured into three Jupyter notebooks. The project aims to extract, process, and analyze textual mental health data using various methodologies.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Getting the Main Text Data
**File:** `1. Getting the main text data.ipynb`

- This notebook focuses on extracting and preprocessing the main textual data.
- It includes data collection, cleaning, and initial exploratory analysis.
- The extracted text serves as the foundation for further analysis.

### 2. Develop Methodology
**File:** `2. Develop Methodology.ipynb`

- This notebook outlines the methodology for processing and analyzing the text.
- It includes techniques such as tokenization, vectorization, and feature extraction.
- Various text mining techniques may be explored to gain insights from the data.

### 3. Implementation
**File:** `3. Implementation.ipynb`

- This notebook applies the developed methodology to analyze the textual data.
- It may include machine learning models, statistical analysis, or visualization of results.
- The final output and conclusions are drawn based on the implemented techniques.

## Getting Started
To use this repository, ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Clone the repository and run the notebooks in the following order:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository>
jupyter notebook
```

Open each notebook sequentially in Jupyter and execute the code cells.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries may be required:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `nltk`
- `matplotlib`

Install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib
```
